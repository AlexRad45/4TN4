# 4TN4
The goal of this project is to design a simple
lossy image compression method. The basic idea
this compression method is split into 2 main parts.
The first part consists of an encoder, which
compresses the image as much as possible while
preserving as much necessary data as possible. The
second part consists of a decoder, which uses the
encoder data bit stream to reconstruct the image to
an acceptable quality
