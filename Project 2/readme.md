The goal of this project is to design an image compression method using machine learning and CNN. The basic idea this compression method is split into 2 main parts. The first part consists of an encoder, which compresses the image as much as possible while preserving as much necessary data as possible. The second part consists of a decoder, which uses a trained model to predict the expected outcome of the image after upsampling
